projects in my spare time

<bold>pic-print (python):</bold>
project that takes in an image file as input and outputs an altered version of that image depending on which options are set
options:
<ul>
  <li>lineart</li>
  <li>
    <ul>color
      <li>scheme</li>
      <li>lineart with specific colors filled in</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<bold>proxy-vote (python):</bold>
project that searches for proxies, connects to the first available, and votes for the Youtube creater Contrapoints, because I wanted her to win an online poll that was happening in ~December 2019
